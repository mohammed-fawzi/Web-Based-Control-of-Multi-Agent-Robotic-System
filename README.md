# Web-Based-Control-of-Multi-Agent-Robotic-System
##### Graduation project 2017

## OVERVIEW

   In this project, we develop a complete platform for coordination and control of multi-agent robotic system composed of a set of mobile robots that can be used to transport objects with different sizes and weights in an indoor environment.
The main objective of the system is to use low-cost robots with limited capabilities and make them cooperate to perform complex tasks such as transportation of heavy objects that canâ€™t be transported by a single robot. 
As a proof of concept, the platform is applied to three omnidirectional mobile robots connected to the main server that assign tasks to them and coordinate their work to meet client requirements. 
A web-based interface is developed for clients to interact with the system.
